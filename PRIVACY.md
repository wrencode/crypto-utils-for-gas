# Privacy Policy

The Crypto Utils for Google Sheets ("Crypto Utils") add-on (and its related services) requires access to user information in order to provide service. Access to all user information is governed by these terms as well as Google's Terms of Service. If Crypto Utils is used to connect to other third-party services & APIs, those services' Terms of Service also apply.

### Collected Information

Personal information is only requested when it is needed to provide service to the user. It is collected by fair and lawful means, with the knowledge and consent of the user. Users are also informed as to why their data is being collected and how it will be used. Information that may be collected includes:

* Access to the user's Google Sheets, so Crypto Utils can provide you with service requiring the ability to modify your spreadsheets with retrieved and calculated information.
* Access to the user's locale, so Crypto Utils can correctly use time-based calculations.
* Access to make external requests on behalf of the user, so Crypto Utils can fetch data from all third-party APIs configured by the user and utilized within Crypto Utils.
* Access to display updates and changes in the user's Google Sheets UI, so Crypto Utils can provide feedback and information to the user.

### Data Retention and Deletion

Crypto Utils does not retain or export any accessed user information outside of the Google Sheets in which the add-on is installed. Users can revoke Crypto Utils' permissions to access their data at any time simply by uninstalling the add-on and revoking data access in the "Manage third-party access" section of their [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security) page.

### Third Party APIs & Services

Crypto Utils uses a variety of third-party services & APIs in order to retrieve data on behalf of the user. Some of these services/APIs require API keys provided by the user. All API keys should be restricted to "read only" where applicable (such as for cryptocurrency exchange API access).

Crypto Utils has no control over the content and practices of any third-party services, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.

### Acceptance of Policy

Users are free to refuse Crypto Utils' request for access to their data, with the understanding that it will make Crypto Utils unable to provide some or all of the advertised services.

Continued use of the Crypto Utils service will be regarded as acceptance of this privacy policy. Any questions about how user data is handled can be sent to [privacy@wrencode.com](mailto:privacy@wrencode.com).

This privacy policy is effective as of July 1st, 2022.
